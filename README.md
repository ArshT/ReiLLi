# ReiLLi

ReiLLi is a PyTorch project that consists of easy-to-understand and reliable implementations of several Model-Free Reinforcement Learning algorithms. The project is primarily intended for beginners to help them understand and conveniently use Model-Free RL algorithms  for training agents  that can perform optimally in several popular OpenAI gym environments

## Algorithms
The following algorithms are implemented:
- Deep Q-Learning with discrete action space
- Double Deep Q-Learning with discrete action space
- REINFORCE with discrete action space
- A2C with discrete action space
- PPO with both discrete and continuous action space
- DDPG with continuous action space
- TD3 with discretized action space
- SAC with continuous action space
